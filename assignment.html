        <h2>Self-defence: Ban on firearms still in force, CP warns Matawalle</h2>
        <h5>28 June,2022</h5>
        <p>The Zamfara State Commissioner of Police, Ayuba Elkana, has said the embargo on firearms licence is still in force, noting that the police have stopped issuing licence to citizens who wished to own guns.<br>

            The police boss stated this, on Sunday, in response to inquiries from The PUNCH about the directive by the state government that the police command should issue gun licence to those eligible to bear arms.<br>
            
            The Zamfara State Commissioner for Information, Ibrahim Dosara, had in a statement on Sunday, disclosed that the government had directed residents of the state to prepare and obtain guns to defend themselves against bandits who have been terrorising the state.<br>
            
            The government, therefore, directed the state Commissioner of Police to issue licence to all those who qualify and are willing to obtain guns to defend themselves.</p>

        <h2>What kidnappers told us about Buhari: Methodist Prelate</h2>
        <h5>28 June,2022</h5>
        <p>
        The Prelate of the Methodist Church of Nigeria, His Eminence, Samuel Kanu-Uche, who was abducted by gunmen suspected to be kidnappers has said the criminal elements expressed anger about President Muhammadu Buhari.<br>

During a press briefing in Lagos on Tuesday, the cleric, who said the kidnappers showed him decomposing bodies of some past victims, revealed that they are Fulani boys.

He said the assailants vowed that they would chew the president if he fell into their hands, saying Buhari has disappointed them.<br>

He said, “They even said that if they get Buhari, they will chew him to pieces because he had disappointed them.

“We were taken into the bush and we trekked up to 15 kilometres. Eventually at 11 pm, they said we should negotiate and each of us should pay N50m, making N150m”.<br>

Kanu-Uche confirmed that the men later pegged the ransom at N100m.
        </p>
    
<p> The cleric told newsmen that he reached out to leaders of the church and his wife to raise the money by all means to secure his release.
    
DAILY POST recalls that Kanu-Uche was kidnapped on Sunday along the Enugu-Port Harcourt Expressway in the Umunneochi Local Government Area of Abia State while on his way to the airport.

        <h5>28 June,2022</h5>

        <li>Seizes London-bound Meth consignments at Lagos airport, Imo</li>
            <li>Nabs two wanted drug kingpins behind seized Tincan port shipments</li> 
        </ul>
            Operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) have arrested a Brazilian returnee, Igwedum Uche Benson at the arrival hall of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Ikeja Lagos with pellets of cocaine concealed in his private part.</P>
            <p>Igwedum was arrested at the Lagos airport on Monday, June 20, upon his arrival on Ethiopian Airlines from Sao Paulo, Brazil via Addis Ababa.

                Spokesperson for the Agency, Femi Babafemi, in a statement yesterday, said preliminary investigations revealed that the suspect had swallowed 50 wraps of cocaine before departing Brazil and excreted 48 pellets in Addis Ababa where he handed them over to another person.
                
                Babafemi said the suspect claimed he was unable to excrete the remaining two wraps at the hotel room in Addis Ababa before boarding his flight but later excreted them in the aircraft restroom during the flight from Ethiopia to Lagos.
                
                ALSO, operatives of the MMIA command of NDLEA on Saturday night, June 25,  arrested a drug kingpin, Onyekachi Chukwuma Macdonald behind attempts to export 40 parcels of Methamphetamine popularly called Mkpuru Mmiri in local parlance, to London, United Kingdom through the NAHCO export shed of the Lagos airport.
                
                The arrest, Babafemi said, was after three weeks of painstaking investigation and tracking. According to NDLEA spokesperson, Onyekachi was arrested at Manacola estate, Alakuko area of Lagos at the weekend, three weeks after his Mkpuru Mmiri consignment weighing 2.05kilogrammes was intercepted at the airport and his freight agent, Peter Christopher Anikan arrested on June 7.

                During his interview, the suspect said he had lived in Dubai, UAE for 10 years before returning to Nigeria in 2019.
                Also, he stated that after his return to Nigeria, he opened a phone accessories shop in Sango Otta, Ogun State, but the business collapsed. He then started sending cigarettes to London and decided to conceal the illicit drug in the consignment after advice by a friend.
                
                SIMILARLY, the anti narcotic agency on Wednesday, June 22,  seized another consignment of 2kg Mkpuru Mmiri at a courier house in Owerri, Imo State.
                
                The seized cargo had ankara and lace fabrics in which two cylindrical cellophanes containing the drug heading to Hong Kong were concealed.
                
                Also, at the Lagos airport, NDLEA operatives on Friday, June 24, intercepted 500,000 tablets of tramadol 225mg packed in 10 cartons and labelled tramaking imported from Karachi, Pakistan on Emirates Airline. The consignment weighing 407.60kg was seized during a joint examination with Customs and NAFDAC officials.
                
                Same day, a Dubai, UAE-bound passenger, Alegbeleye Taiwo, was arrested at the departure hall of the MMIA with 40 ampoules of pentazocine injection. The 21-year-old suspect claims he’s from Osun State.
                
                MEANWHILE, NDLEA operatives have arrested  two kingpins behind the importation of two recent drug consignments from Canada concealed in vehicle containers through the Tincan seaport in Apapa, Lagos.
                
                One of them, Gboyega Ayoola Elegbeji,  was arrested at his house, 14 Bakare Street, Idi Araba, Lagos on Wednesday, June 22, for importing a 40ft container TRHU7874497 containing 33 parcels of cannabis indica (Colorado) weighing16.5kg.</p>

        <h2>ASUU strike: Ngige not headache of varsity lecturers, says labour ministry</h2>
        <h5>28 June,2022</h5>
        <p>
            The Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment has warned those accusing its minister, Dr. Chris Ngige, of being the headache of the university lecturers to desist from doing so.<br>


            This came on the heels of lingering crisis of multiple strike actions of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and other university-based unions.<br>
            
            A statement by the Ministry<super>’</super>s Head, Press and Public Relations, Olajide Oshundun, made some clarifications, which, it said, were necessary so that the public would understand its role in the Ministry of Labour as conciliators and arbitrators in a labour dispute.<br>
            
            According to him, “ASUU should know that we are arbitrators and conciliators. We cannot manufacture agreements. Regardless, we are not constrained from listening to the government side and pushing them to do their own bit as quickly as possible.”
            <br>
            
            He clarified why the ASUU was not invited to the Thursday meeting at the Presidential Villa.
