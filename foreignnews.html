    <p>The Forum satellite will be assembled by aerospace giant Airbus at its factory in Stevenage.</p>

        It will monitor far-infrared radiation coming up from our planet's surface.<br>
        
        It's this particular type of light that makes molecules of gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapour vibrate, leading to a heating of the atmosphere - a key aspect of climate change.<br>
        
        <p>Forum is an Earth observation mission of the European Space Agency (Esa). Its procurement contract with Airbus is worth €160m (£140m).</p>

        <h2>January 6 hearings: Trump urged armed supporters to storm Capitol - aide</h2>

            <span id="active">
                Donald Trump knew supporters had weapons when he urged them to storm the Capitol to overturn the 2020 election, a former White House aide has said.</span><br>

                Ex-aide Cassidy Hutchinson testified to the committee probing the 6 January 2021 riots that Mr Trump and his top staff knew the potential for violence.<br>
                
                But a planned rally went ahead, with Mr Trump saying the armed attendees were "not here to hurt me".<br>
                
                The president also demanded to join the march on the Capitol himself, she said.<br>
                
               <p>In a series of public hearings, the Democratic-led 6 January committee has sought to link the former president directly to the efforts to prevent Congress from certifying the 2020 election results.
