                The American great, 40, returned to the same Centre Court where she had limped out injured last year with a passionate display in a 7-5 1-6 7-6 (10-7) defeat.</p>

Willed on by a fervent crowd, Williams answered questions over her fitness with a dynamic display that put her two points from a win before Tan edged it.<br>

The burning question now is surely 'was this her last Wimbledon'?

<p>"That's a question I can't answer," she told a news conference. "I don't know.

    <p>
        Chelsea are close to agreeing a £55m deal with Leeds United to buy 25-year-old Brazil forward Raphinha, who is also attracting interest from Arsenal and Barcelona.</p>

<p>Chelsea have turned their attention to 27-year-old Inter Milan and Slovakia defender Milan Skriniar, who is also a target for Paris St-Germain, after deeming the £102m release clause of Juventus and Netherlands centre-back Matthijs de Ligt, 22, as too expensive.</p>

<p>PSG have agreed personal terms with Skriniar as well as Lille's Portugal midfielder Renato Sanches, 24, and 23-year-old Italy striker Gianluca Scamacca, who plays for Sassuolo. The French champions now have to agree deals with each of the trio's clubs.</p>

<p>Chelsea have been linked with a third Manchester City player. The Blues want to buy Ukraine international Oleksandr Zinchenko, 25, from the Premier League champions having already opened talks about signing England forward Raheem Sterling, 27, from them and being linked with Dutch defender Nathan Ake, 27.</p>

<P>Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag hopes the expected signing of Barcelona's Dutch midfielder Frenkie de Jong, 25, will convince Denmark playmaker Christian Eriksen, 30, to join the Old Trafford club.</p>

<p>Frenkie de Jong
Why Erik ten Hag wants reunion with midfielder at Manchester United</p>

<p>Tottenham have stepped up their pursuit of Everton and Brazil forward Richarlison, 25, but a £20m offer that also included Dutch winger Steven Bergwijn, 24, has been rejected by the Toffees.</p>

<p>Middlesbrough are growing frustrated at Tottenham stalling on a deal for England Under-21 right-back Djed Spence and that could open the door for Nottingham Forest to sign the 21-year-old, who helped the City Ground side get promoted to the Premier League last season.</p>

<p>Crystal Palace are close to signing Lens midfielder Cheick Doucoure in a deal worth 21m euros (£18m) plus add-ons for the 22-year-old Mali international.</p>

<p>Fulham have been given permission to speak with Brazilian midfielder Andreas Pereira after agreeing a fee with Manchester United, although the 26-year-old appears to prefer to stay at Brazilian side Flamengo where he is on loan

        <h2>Blessing Okagbare: Nigerian sprinter's doping ban extended to 11 years</h2>
        <img width="380" src="./blessing.jpg" alt="Blessing Okagbare was suspended during the 2021 Olympics in Tokyo">
        <h5>28 June,2022</h5>
        <p>
            Nigerian sprinter Blessing Okagbare has been handed an extra one-year ban for additional doping violations to add to her existing 10-year suspension.

            The Athletics Integrity Unit charged her with "evading sample collection, and tampering or attempted tampering with the doping control process".
            
            ADVERTISEMENT
            
            In February, the 33-year-old was handed her original ban for "multiple breaches of anti-doping rules".
            
            She was suspended during the 2021 Tokyo Olympics after failing a drug test.
            
            As a result of Okagbare's additional ban, Nigeria has lost its potential qualification place in the women's 4x100m relay at July's World Championships in Oregon.
            
            Six days after she evaded sample collection - on 13 June 2021 - she competed in the relay event at Nigeria's Olympic trials, helping her team to qualify for the World Championships. However, all results involving Okagbare have now been disqualified.
            
            "Over the years, we have repeatedly seen how one person's actions adversely affect team-mates who have trained hard and worked honestly for their results," AIU head Brett Clothier said in a statement.
            
            "In this instance, Nigeria has lost an important qualification spot. Those are the rules and we will not compromise on integrity."
            
            Okagbare, the 2008 Olympic long jump silver medallist, was a medal contender for the women's 100m in Tokyo last year and won her heat in 11.05 seconds.
            
            But she was ruled out of the semi-finals after the AIU said she had tested positive for a human growth hormone following an out-of-competition test on 19 July.
